## Pain and Purpose

Pain is the essence of purpose

The deepest pits of the soul ache frantically 
Surpassing all the superficial

It's an anchor point,
Gives meaning in the waves of chaos
Provides a direction, an intention 

It saves us from ourselves



# Bailarines en el viento

Tierras donde crecen fissuras,
Por el agua corriendo,
De las mismas lágrimas,
Que dejan cortes calientes en nesutra carne.

Fuentes feroz,
Que brotan el trigo de la alma.

Mira bien a la montaña.
Las fissuras son tan potentes
Que las arrugas en la cara de la abuela.

Asi que de le espacio,
Cuando te nasca la tormenta de 10.000 años.

# Dancers in the wind

Dance with your currents,
Like the leaves with the wind.

Lands where fissures grow,
With the running water,
From the same tears,
That leave hot cuts on our flesh.

Fierce springs,
That germinate the wheat of the soul.

Take a good look at the mountain.
The fissures are as powerful
As the wrinkles on grandmother's face.

So give it space,
When the 10,000-year-old storm swells up.

#Spring time!

A seed begins small,
modest and shy.

But given the right soil,
it sprouts,
slowly fingering with firey roots,
gently pressing down, deeper,
deeper into a moist darkness,
softly sucking, gripping.

As the soil crumbles,
moaning in silent abandonment,
the sprout rises up,
gasping for air, thick with fluid,
it's flowering head blooming,
flushing deep, a bold red.

Spring time! :)
