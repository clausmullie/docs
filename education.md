First of all there is me; then there is mine; then there is trouble.

## Ibn Arabi

### Perplexity

The Divine guidance consists in the fact that man be brought to perplexity, (in the face of suprarational Reality), so that he may know that existence is entirely perplexity (meaning oscillation between two Divice aspects apparently contradictory); but, perplexity is instability (in the sense of non-inertia) and movement, and movement is life, so that there is neither inertia nor death, but pure existence, without absence.

Ibn Arabi

### Service

In the Servery…

Please handle the tableware with care and respect. Each item is unique, a perfect servant, and is not expendable. 

Take this opportunity of working in the Servery to cultivate care and attentive regard for all living things, including these inanimate objects you are handling; as they embody their purpose in existence perfectly, so they may represent for us our own potential as human beings. 

‘In concordance and in submission there is no higher Creatue than the inanimate object… They know the way they are used and the Value of their Manner of usage in accordance with their innate nature.’ 

Fesus al Hakim, Ibn Arabi 

### Garden

O Marvel !
A garden amidst flames.
My Heart has become capable of every form.
It is a pasture for gazelles,
a cloister for Christian monks,
a temple for idols,
the pilgrim's Ka'aba,
the tables of the Torah,
the book of the Koran.
Whatever way Love's camels take,
that is my religion and my faith.


Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi from The Interpreter of Ardent Desires

### A Hundred Thousand Mirrors

If a beloved was looked upon and a hundred thousand mirrors were placed around her, how many hundred thousands would that beloved be seen as; but in effect she is only one. All the same, those mirrors, according to each one’s aptitude, she would appear in some as brilliant, in some as sad, in some straight, in some crooked. Consequently, if a man saw the face of his beloved in one mirror and denied the other mirrors, he would not be a gnostic. He who is a gnostic acknowledges each. In whatever mirror he sees her, he affirms and perhaps he even sees her without a mirror. 

To how many hundred thousand eyes was visible this evident image.

Again He Himself has become desirous of Him own Beauty. 

It is not necessary to explain further than this example. The processor of gnosis, the longer he thinks and takes pleasure in the taste, can find many examples.

A Hundred Thousand Mirrors - Ibn ‘Arabi, The Kernel of the Kernel

### The Elephant

Several  blind people were gathered in a place. They began to discuss a matter: “We wonder if we could see an elephant.” The keeper of the elephants took them to the elephant house. Each one found a part of the elephant and help on to it - some to the ear, some to the foot, some to the belly, some to the trunk. After having known the elephant in this fashion, they began to argue among themselves. The one who clung to the leg of the elephant said the elephant was like a column. The one that held the ear said the elephant was like a napkin, and the one who knew the elephant by its belly said it was like a barrel. In short, whatever member they held on to they knew the elephant like that part; their beliefs were such. 

The person who has a belief through imitation is in this state. He clings onto something definite and remains there. In that dimensional state they remain imprisoned. 

Whoever remains in prison in the definite dimension

Will be totally saddened when laid out in the earth.

Whatever may happen, the Gnostic will not be caught up in one definite belief because he is wise unto himself. 

The Elephant - Ibn Arabi, The Kernel of the Kernel

### A Knowledge Like Light

What God taught to the bees
Doesn't belong to the lions or wild ass.
The bees make a home of juicy sweetness -
God opened the door of that knowing.

What God taught the silkworm -
does any elephant have such expertise?
Adam, though made of earth,
was given knowledge by God,

a knowledge like light
that pierced the Seven Heavens.

A Knowledge Like Light - Rumi

### Guesthouse

This being human is a guest house.
Every morning a new arrival.
A joy, a depression, a meanness,
some momentary awareness comes
as an unexpected visitor.
Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if they’re a crowd of sorrows,
who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture,
still, treat each guest honorably.
He may be clearing you out
for some new delight.
The dark thought, the shame, the malice,
meet them at the door laughing,
and invite them in.
Be grateful for whoever comes,
because each has been sent
as a guide from beyond.

Jalaluddin Rumi

### Wean yourself

Little by little, wean yourself.
This is the gist of what I have to say.
From an embryo, whose nourishment comes in the blood,
move to an infant drinking milk,
to a child on solid food,
to a searcher after wisdom,
to a hunter of more invisible game.

Think how it is to have a conversation with an embryo.
You might say, "The world outside is vast and intricate.
There are wheatfields and mountain passes,
and orchards in bloom.

At night there are millions of galaxies, and in sunlight
the beauty of friends dancing at a wedding."

You ask the embryo why he, or she, stays cooped up
in the dark with eyes closed.

Listen to the answer.

There is no "other world."
I only know what I've experienced.
You must be hallucinating.”

### Lamps

The lamps are different.
But the Light is the same.
So many garish lamps in the dying brain's lamp shop,
Forget about them.
Concentrate on essence, concentrate on Light.
In lucid bliss, calmly smoking off its own hold fire,
The Light streams toward you from all things,
All people, all possible permutations of good,
evil, thought, passion.
The lamps are different,
But the Light is the same.
One matter, one energy, one Light, one Light-mind,
Endlessly emanating all things.
One turning and burning diamond,
One, one, one.
Ground yourself, strip yourself down,
To blind loving silence.
Stay there, until you see
You are gazing at the Light
With its own ageless eyes.


One One One - Mevlana Rumi (1207 - 1273)

### Being a student

It is a pleasure to be a student

I am a student.
I have been a student as long as I remember
And it is a pleasure to be a student.

It is a pleasure to learn that I don’t know.
It is a pleasure to learn that I already know.
It is a pleasure to learn that I was mistaken.

It is a joy to learn from Great Masters.
It is a joy to learn by sharing what I learnt.
It is a joy to learn how to be what I am.

I seek to learn about the world around me.
I seek to learn about what I actually am.
I seek to learn how to be a proper human being.

Clouds show me the nature of my world.
Rivers show me the nature of myself.
Babies show me how to be more human. I am a student.

I will be a student as long as I live.
And it is a pleasure to be a student.

Ringu Tulku

### Because of an innocent misunderstanding 

Because of an innocent misunderstanding you think that you are a human being in the relative world seeking the experience of oneness, but actually you are the One expressing itself as the experience of being a human being.

Because of an innocent misunderstanding  - Adyashanti

### Wind in the house

Keep the Real always passionately and stubbornly in view and duality will dissolve, burn away like a paper-chain in the fire of Love. Duality, after all, is a characteristic of the branches of a tree; its root is One. 

Think of a wind gusting through a house. It flips up the edges of carpets, makes all the rugs in all the rooms rustle and leap. It throws into the air sticks and straws, ruffles a pool and transforms its surface into a coat of shimmering chain mail, gets trees and their branches dancing like acrobats. All of these states appear distinct, appear different, especially to the normal mind that so loves to differentiate and to categorize everything. Yet, from the standpoint of the root cause and from the standpoint of essential reality, all of these seemingly distinct states and events are in fact set in motion, caused and orchestrated by the one omnipresent, invisible, infinitely supple wind. 

Meditate on this. Something astonishing will suddenly become clear. 

The Wind in the House - A Harvey, Light upon Light


### One unity

Unity. The One. God. The Great Spirit. Mirror of wonders. The still eternity. Permanence. There are countless names for it. 

According to the one perspective, one cannot actually speak of the One, because to speak of it is to make an object of it, implying separation from it, so misrepresenting the essence of oneness from the start, a mysterious conundrum. 

The One is the limit of all, first before the beginning and last after the end, alpha and omega, the mould that shapes all things and the one thing shaped by all the moulds, the origin from which the universe emerges, the universe itself, and the center to which it returns. It is point, seed and destination.

One is echoed in all things and treats all equally. Its stability among numbers is unique, one remaining one when multiplied or divided by itself, and one of anything is uniquely that one thing. One is alone, all one, and no thing can exist to describe it.

All things are immersed in the shoreless ocean of Unity. The quality of oneness permeates everything, and while there is nothing without it, there is also no thing within it, as even a communication or idea requires parts in relationship. Like light from the Sun or gentle rain the One is unconditional in its love, yet its majesty and mystery remain veiled, and beyond apprehension, for the One can only be understood by itself. It is alone, all one, and no thing can exist to describe it. 

The Monad - Miranda Lundy, Sacred Number

### Desiderata

GO PLACIDLY amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.

Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.

Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.

Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.

Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.

Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.

Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.

Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.

Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.

And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.

## Rupi Kaur:

capitalism got inside my head
and made me think my only value
is how much i produce
for people to consume
i measure my self-worth
by how productive i’ve been
but no matter how hard i work
i still feel inadequate
